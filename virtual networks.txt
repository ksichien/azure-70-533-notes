--- User Defined Routes ---

UDR's override the default network flow in Azure:
- Local VNet rule: specifies VM-to-VM routing within the same subnet, no middle-man hop.
- On-premises rule: specifies all routes to Azure to use the VPN appliance as the next hop.
- Internet rule: specifies all VNet traffic to use the gateway or load balancer as its next hop.

How to set up a UDR:
- Create an appliance VM, gateway or network.
- Affix a static address to that appliance/gateway/network.
- Define a UDR that assigns the address prefixes that should be routed via the UDR, the type of hop and its address.
- Assign that UDR to the subnet.

UDR 'next hop' types:
- Virtual network: send packets to another Azure VNet or a subnet within the same VNet.
- Virtual network gateway: the VPN gateway for a Site-to-Site VPN connection.
- Internet: the internet gateway.
- Virtual Appliance: A VM that is acting as a network appliance.
- None: a black hole that discards all packets sent to it.

When to use a UDR:
- Any time you want to insert a layer of security or specific traffic flow between network boundaries.
    - Force tunneling through an alternate/on-premises network. 
    - Run traffic through a specialized network appliance.
        - Intermediate firewalls.
        - Special load balancers.
        - Intermediary/specialized protocol handling.

--- Network Security Groups ---

NSG's have pessimistic rules, meaning unless something is allowed, it is blocked.

Priority rules are executed in order, priority rules can range from 100 to 4096.

Connections are stateful, meaning that if a specific inbound connection is allowed,
the server is also allowed to return a response on the same port to the same IP address.
For example, if an inbound connection is allowed on port 80 over TCP, the server can also respond on port 80 over TCP,
even if there is an outbound rule blocking all traffic on port 80 over TCP.

By default, the NSG only allows incoming RDP connections on port 3389 with priority 1000.

--- IP Addressing ---

Private IP addresses are usually used for internal application gateways, internal load balancers and virtual machines.

They are dynamic by default, a vm restart will let the vm retain the dynamic IP address,
but a stop and start will release and reassign a different one to that vm.

There is a maximum of 4096 private IP addresses per virtual network, 50 per virtual subnet.
Private static IP addresses should be used for domain controllers, firewalls and vm's providing a service that need to retain an IP address.

Public IP addresses are usually used for external application gateways, external load balancers, vpn gateways and virtual machines.

While IPv4 addresses can be dynamic or static, IPv6 addresses are always dynamic.
There is a maximum of 20 public static IP addresses per subscription.

Dynamic addresses are assigned when the resource they are associated to is started and released when it is stopped.
It is very likely that upon restart, this resource will be assigned a new IP address.
There is a maximum of 60 public dynamic IP addresses per subscription.

A public IP resource with an IPv4 address cannot convert it into an IPv6 address and vice-versa.

Static public IP addresses are best used to prevent the need to update a DNS A record's IP address or when using an SSL certificate bound to a specific IP address.

Azure virtual network DNS can be used together with the FQDN of a server to avoid the need for a static IP address.

--- Hybrid Networking ---

Point-to-Site VPN (P2S) is for providing a single user or machine access to an Azure virtual network.
It is certificate-based and does not require a VPN device or local public IP address.
Throughput is limited to 100 Mbps and traffic is sent over public internet via SSTP.
There is a maximum of 128 connections.
Supports only Windows 7/8/10 and Windows Server 2008/2012 (R2).
Limited access to VM's.
The connection is not persistent.

Site-to-Site VPN (S2S) is for providing a small group of clients behind an on-prem network device access to an Azure virtual network.
A public IP address and a compatible VPN device are required.
Throughput is limited to 100 Mbps and traffic is sent over public internet via IPSec.
There is a maximum of 10 to 30 IPSec tunnels, depending on VPN gateway service tier.
Supports all operating systems.
Limited access to VM's.
The connection is persistent, clients can automatically reconnect after a restart.

ExpressRoute is a dedicated, private connection to Azure.
Throughput ranges from 50 Mbps to 10 Gbps depending on gateway SKU.
Increased data security because network traffic is not sent over the public internet.
Access to all Azure services through Private (Azure virtual networks), Public (Storage services, SQL DB and Web Apps) and Microsoft (Dynamics 365, PowerBI, Office 365) peering.

These services are not charged for, but access to their VPN gateways is, per hour.
P2S and S2S use Basic, Standard and High Performance tiers.
ExpressRoute can access an additional tier, Ultra Performance and is also considerably more expensive.

--- S2S VPN Gateway Configuration ---

Requirements:
- Azure:
    - Gateway subnet
    - Azure VPN Gateway
    - Local network gateway
    - VPN connection definition
- On-premises:
    - Supported VPN device
    - Shared key

Route-based VPN's (Dynamic) are most common, don't reference a specific tunnel and allow multi-site connections (more than one on-prem network can connect to Azure).

Policy-baed VPN's (Static) are the easiest to setup, but are less flexible and have limited connectivity.

When setting up an S2S VPN connection, it is very important to keep in mind that all the adress spaces in all sites cannot overlap.
For example, the Azure VNet is in the 10.20.0.0/16 and 10.21.0.0/16 address spaces, the on-prem local network is in the 10.0.0.0/16 and 10.1.0.0/16 address spaces.

An Azure VPN Gateway is a virtual appliance that connects an Azure virtual network.
When setting it up, a virtual network backing the gateway, a public IP address and a gateway SKU must be provided.

All gateways (VPN & application gateways) must live in a gateway subnet.
During setup, it must be named "GatewaySubnet" and it is best practice to have the gateway address range as the first subnet within a virtual network.

The Local Network Gateway is required to connect to your on-premises network.
During setup, the on-prem VPN device's public IP address and all address spaces available to the Azure VPN Gateway must be provided.

For on-premises VPN device setup, it is always required to generate a shared key and add the Azure VPN Gateway's IP address.
